(Here art refers to anything such as, making a video, doing a standup, painting something...creating something.)

The world of art is bifurcated into two.

1) as a commodity.
2) for the pleasure for making art.

In case 1, it dosen't matter whether the art is generated by an AI or by a human or  through magic...because the customer dosen't see the process, they only see the end result. If this art has evoked an impact in the customer's emotions, the art has done its purpose.


In case 2, the process matters!

The beauty of art in this case, lies in the human connection. It lies in the imperfections, the vulnerabilities, the joy and sadness. Art is a reflection of our inner soul. 


A machine could generate a perfect visually striking painting..but when a human makes a painting, each stroke is intentionally made, by a person, who has lived in this world, who has went through times of joy and sadness. Each stroke here, is a way for that person to express his emotions, a way for him to understand this world.

But I would like to remind you of this:

When photography came around, people thought it was a fake art.
"**You press a button, and the machine generates art instantly, whereas it takes me weeks to paint something.**"

In time, people realized that to make good photographs, it takes effort. We gotta study lighting, framing, timing...This photographer has to train his eye to make good photographs. It is art.


Similarly, I think ai-generated art is also an art of some kind...because a human  prompted the ai to come up with something he imagined. The AI model is like the paint brush in this case. He might have to study proper prompting techniques to arrive at a representation that satisfies his imagination. That is also art,na?



In the end, if the artist is happy with his art, or if it had brought joy and happiness to this world ,the art has done its purpose.
