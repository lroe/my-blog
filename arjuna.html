        <p>Ever since I installed Airtel Wi-Fi (with that unlimited movie and web series streaming package), my dad has been playing the <em>Mahabharatam</em> (2013) series on loop , every single day.</p>

        <p>If you come to my house these days, you’ll either hear the news or this series playing in the background.</p>

        <p>Now, I don’t really watch these shows since I don’t have the time, but whenever I pass by the TV, someone is always doing some kind of <em>tapas</em>.</p>

        <p>One day, I saw Arjuna isolating himself from everyone and going into the wilderness to meditate. All I knew about <em>tapas</em> was that it meant going off to the forest and meditating for days or even months.</p>

        <p>This time, though, I got curious about why Arjuna did it. So, I “ChatGPT-ed” it.</p>

        <p>Turns out, Arjuna went into <em>tapas</em>, practicing extreme self-discipline to please Lord Shiva so that he could receive a divine weapon , something that would “level him up” and help him defeat powerful enemies.</p>

        <p>For some reason, I found this really fascinating. The same concept can actually be applied to our own lives.</p>

        <p>For example, say you want to learn a new skill ,like becoming an artist. You could dedicate a few months of your life fully immersed in learning art (<em>your own tapas</em>).</p>

        <p>And if you put in enough effort, the “god” - or the universe , will recognize your dedication and reward you with the skill (<em>the weapon</em>).</p>
