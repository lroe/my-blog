About the Blog
Jeevan.life is a platform where I share my journey through technology, creativity, and personal growth. Posts cover:

AI applications, such as dialogue-aware medical AI for disease detection.
Startup stories, including validation processes, hard-learned advice, and pivots in edtech.
Creative explorations in 3D modeling (e.g., Blender projects like donuts, animations, and cartoony renders).
Reflections on art, coding, and learning in an AI-dominated world.
Cultural insights from mythology (e.g., Mahabharata-inspired pieces).
Practical tips on hardware limitations, animation practice, and skill-building roadmaps.

The blog started in May 2025 with pencil drawing progress and has evolved to include animations, startup insights, and more. Check out key posts like "The Startup Advice I Learnt The Hard Way" or "Should we make art when AI can do it?"
