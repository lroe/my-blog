      <h2>A Journey of Validating a Healthcare Startup</h2>

      <div class="post-content">

        <p>I wanted to pivot to another startup using the knowledge that I have gathered so far.</p>

        <p>I thought about doing something that makes revenue from day one.</p>

        <p>I had an idea, which was to build voice agents for hospitals that talk in Malayalam.</p>

        <p>Voice agents are a saturated niche in English speaking places, but in hospitals in Kerala, people call for everything and they speak in Malayalam. Apparently, there are no good tech people doing that, so we thought, sure, why not.</p>

        <p>So first things first, we need to validate the idea before we even work on it.</p>

        <p>We went to five nearby mid tier hospitals and pitched it.</p>

        <p>Everyone said they were struggling with this because hospitals were bombarded with calls and their staff could not handle all the calls.</p>

        <p>So it is a proven problem and if we could implement the stuff as we pitched, they would buy it.</p>

        <p>So easy, the idea is validated and it is easy to build.</p>

        <p>And I did build the product.</p>

        <p>But then I did the math.</p>

        <p>It turns out, an average hospital receives about 200 calls every day. Assume each call is about five minutes long.</p>

        <p>The AI processing bill itself will cost 60k₹ per month per hospital, at the minimum.</p>

        <p>And our service charge will be like 10k₹ per month.</p>

        <p>An average voice receptionist costs like 15k₹ per month. A hospital could employee 4 additational staffs for 60k rupees.So I am not sure whether the hospitals are ready for this.</p>

        <p>But I know sooner, the AI voice cost might get reduced and it becomes more affordable. Maybe by the time you are reading this, the cost would have reduced so much.</p>

        <p>So by then this tech could enter the Kerala market.</p>

        <p>It was a great experience going to hospitals and pitching the ideas.</p>

        <p>But the lesson I learned this time is, do the math too along with validation.</p>

        <p>We have to know how much profit and money we can make from the business before pitching it out.</p>
