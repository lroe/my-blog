                <p>Lets travel back to the time when a machine that can perform maths accurately and faster than any
                    human was invented.</p>

                <p>Yes, I am speaking about the calculator.</p>

                <p>I'm gonna speak from POV of Engineers & Teachers.</p>

                <h3>1) Engineers:</h3>
                <p>Before calculators came, they used to do very long, tedious steps to calculate arithmetic results
                    such as 18420402/1231 etc..</p>

                <p>The role of engineers is to use maths to solve higher-level physics problems.</p>

                <p>For example, to predict the distance a ball travels in a certain time, we just apply the formula s=ut
                    + 1/2 at^2.</p>

                <p>We input the values of u, t, and a and get the results. Now computing the multiplication and adding
                    them, isnt really what makes an engineer, an engineer..</p>

                <p>Knowing how to use the formula to program move a robotic hand to catch a ball, is what an engineer
                    does.</p>

                <p>So calculators didnt make engineers less intelligent, but they enabled them to compute the results of
                    their thinking rapidly. This let them trial and error more.</p>

                <h3>How is this related to AI?</h3>
                <p>Here AI is the new calculator. But lemme be honest, the comparison is not fully accurate. Instead of
                    giving the computational result as output, AI is giving "ideas" as output.</p>

                <p>Now the role of engineer becomes to take this idea, and apply his own ideas and augment it, so as to
                    build products that help change the world :)</p>

                <p>Now for an engineer to augment the ideas with his own ideas, he needs to understand how to code, how
                    to build circuits, how to do x without AI.</p>

                <h3>2) Teachers:</h3>
                <p>Teachers were really afraid at this time. They thought, if students use calculator to do things like
                    finding the square root, long-division etc, students wouldn't learn these things and so.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the school curriculm was designed in such a way that students were given access to
                    calculator only after they were taught how to do things like long division, taking square roots..etc
                    manually.</p>


                <p>But BUt BUtttttt, we are facing a serious problem right now.</p>

                <p>Right now, what most students do is: they ask the AI to code something, and the ai codes it up.</p>

                <p>The AI might do a good job of building the product..but the student probably wont be having any idea
                    of how the code works. they wont be able to augment their own "ideas" to this ai-generated code
                    because, they dont know the code works. All they will be able to see will be a foreign language
                    doing God KNows what.</p>

                <p>I don't think we can call ourself a coder, if we cant manually add changes to a code, without
                    ai-assistance.</p>

                <p>Even a 8 year old kid could type something like "build me a spotify clone" in gemini3 and it might
                    build it. THAT doesnt make this kid a coder or an engineer. It is like, asking someone to do the
                    work and u take the credits for that lol.</p>

                <p>I think, we can call ourself an engineer, if only we can read the code and understand what it is
                    doing. Only then will we be able to augument our ideas properly. Only then we truly become an
                    "engineer"</p>
