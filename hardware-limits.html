      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I was trying to build a realistic 3D model of a brick wall, complete with bricks, cement, and a sense of roughness.</p>

        <p>At first, it was just a flat plane with a brick texture applied to it. Look closely and you’ll notice something missing, it doesn’t <em>feel</em> real. There’s no depth, no tiny creases or uneven surfaces, the bricks don’t bulge out, and the cement doesn’t sink in. Everything looks perfectly flat.</p>

            <figcaption>Brick wall made by applying a random image texture to a plane.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>After going through a few tutorials, I managed to make it look much better, something closer to reality, with depth and shadows.</p>

        <div class="post-images">

        <p>That’s when I hit my hardware limits. My computer isn’t exactly built for heavy 3D graphics. It has only <strong>8 GB of RAM</strong> and an <strong>AMD Ryzen 3000 integrated GPU</strong> (to put it in perspective, it can’t even run GTA IV).</p>

        <p>Tomorrow, I’m upgrading my RAM to <strong>24 GB</strong>, hoping it’ll give a small performance boost. Unfortunately, the graphics card on my laptop is <strong>soldered to the motherboard</strong>, so it can’t be upgraded.</p>

        <p>So for now, I’ll stick with <strong>simpler animations and models</strong>, focus on creativity, not realism. Someday, with better hardware, I’ll revisit the realistic stuff again.</p>
