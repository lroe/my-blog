      <h2>Sculpting a Squid</h2>
      <span class="post-date">October 25, 2025</span>

      <div class="post-content">
       <p>Today I finally opened Blender‚Äôs sculpting workspace and started experimenting. It felt kind of like digital clay , just pushing, pulling, and shaping until something started to look alive. I didn‚Äôt plan anything specific at first, but somehow it turned into a squid ü¶ë.</p>
        <p>It‚Äôs not perfect, but I really liked how smooth sculpting feels once you get the hang of brushes like Grab, Clay Strips, and Inflate. The symmetry feature also helped a lot when shaping the tentacles.</p>
        <p> Even though it‚Äôs rough, seeing something organic take shape from a blob was super satisfying.</p>
