        <p>Movies, Games, Music, Books... these are all different mediums of expressing experiences.</p>

        <p>Now, a movie may contain music, storytelling inspired by books, and 3D models taken from games ... but does
          that make movies something “greater” than music or games? Not at all.</p>

        <p>Some experiences are better told in one medium than the other. For example:</p>

        <div class="post-images">
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Crimeandpunishmentcover.png" alt="Crime and Punishment cover">
            <figcaption>Crime And Punishment Cover Pic</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p><strong><em>Crime and Punishment</em></strong> (Note: I have only started reading it.) In this novel,
          Dostoevsky writes every flicker of thought the character faces - the justifications, the madness, the
          spiritual breakdown - in a way the camera can't directly show.</p>

        <p>The thoughts of the character may be pages and pages long. If we were to make it into a movie, we would
          probably have to reduce those pages of thoughts into something simpler to make it more entertaining.This would
          mean losing a lot of information. Thus, this story is better told through a novel.</p>

        <div class="post-images">
          <figure>
            <img src="images/kerbal.jpg" alt="Kerbal Space Program">
            <figcaption>Kerbal Space Program</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p><strong><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></strong> is a game where you build rockets and make them fly. It
          doesn’t directly teach you the physics of rocket science, but your goal is to make rockets reach space , and
          you can only do that if you truly understand it, since the game’s physics are modeled after reality.</p>

        <p>So what happens is, people turn to textbooks and YouTube videos, study orbital mechanics, and then come back
          to the game just to land their rockets on the Moon.</p>

        <p>This game has had a huge impact ... many gamers have ended up choosing to major in physics because of it.</p>

        <hr style="margin: 40px 0; border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #e6e6e6;">

        <p>If we give word problems like “Find the force and angle needed to throw this bird so that it reaches position
          (x, y)”, the student may not find it very engaging. And if the student gives a wrong answer, they’re simply
          met with a blunt “WRONG ANSWER” as a response.</p>

        <p>This is negative reinforcement.</p>

        <p>But turn that same word problem into an <em>Angry Birds</em>-like game, where they have to hit a specific
          target and can control the force and angle ... and suddenly it becomes fun.</p>

        <p>Even if they fail, they still get to see funny things happen , like walls breaking or objects tumbling
          around. And when they finally get the answer right and win the level, it feels like a celebration.</p>

        <p><strong>Isn’t that fun?</strong></p>
