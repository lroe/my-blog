        <p>You start building.</p>
        <p>You're shipping code, pushing updates, staying in motion.</p>
        <p>On the surface, it looks like progress.</p>
        <p>You're not stuck in planning mode.</p>
        <p>You're doing the work.</p>
        <p>But over time, something shifts.</p>
        <p>Confidence erodes.</p>
        <p>Every decision feels heavier.</p>
        <p>You tweak copy, adjust designs, refactor working features.</p>
        <p>Anything to avoid the real question: What signal would actually make this worth continuing?</p>
        <p>I've lived this.</p>
        <p>Months disappear while you chase ghosts in your own head.</p>
        <p>The idea isn't bad.</p>
        <p>The problem is deeper.</p>
        <p>You're building without external signal.</p>
        <p>The only feedback loop is internal.</p>
        <p>And internal debates never end.</p>
        <p>Because you can argue both sides forever.</p>
        <p>You'll rationalize staying ("It's still early") just as easily as quitting ("This isn't going anywhere").</p>
        <p>Shipping doesn't create confidence.</p>
        <p>Signal does.</p>
        <p>Real signal.</p>
        <p>Someone paying real money.</p>
        <p>A user returning without prompting.</p>
        <p>An email saying "This fixed my exact problem."</p>
        <p>Without that, you're guessing.</p>
        <p>Your mind knows it.</p>
        <p>That's why doubt compounds.</p>
        <p>The fix isn't more building.</p>
        <p>It's defining "worth it" before you start.</p>
        <p>Set hard criteria.</p>
        <p>If I don't get 10 paying users in 8 weeks, I stop.</p>
        <p>If churn stays above 20% after 3 months, I pivot or kill.</p>
        <p>Without guardrails, you drift.</p>
        <p>Hope replaces strategy.</p>
        <p>Tweaking becomes avoidance.</p>
        <p>It feels productive.</p>
        <p>You're "improving."</p>
        <p>But really, you're hiding from reality.</p>
        <p>Scared of silence.</p>
        <p>Scared of "meh."</p>
        <p>If you've built for months with zero users or revenue, that's your wake-up.</p>
        <p>Not to quit.</p>
        <p>But to stop polishing.</p>
        <p>Start selling.</p>
        <p>Talk to people.</p>
        <p>Share the imperfect version.</p>
        <p>Charge early, even if it feels wrong.</p>
        <p>The market gives clarity faster than isolation ever will.</p>
        <p>Reality speaks loudest when you force it to.</p>
        <p><strong>How to break free now.</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Write your kill criteria today. Specific numbers. Hard deadlines.</li>
          <li>Get external feedback immediately. Post publicly. Message 20 potentials. Run cheap tests.</li>
          <li>Prioritize human interaction over features. Next conversation beats next tweak.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once signal hits, good or bad, direction appears.</p>
        <p>Clarity isn't from thinking harder.</p>
        <p>It's from the world responding.</p>
        <p>Give it a voice.</p>
